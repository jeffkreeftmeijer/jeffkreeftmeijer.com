My personal blog. [Check it out](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com)! :D

## Using the source

I open sourced my blog to help others out getting their own Jekyll blog up and running and allowing others to fork it and correct stuff (or even write guest articles).

This means you can use it for whatever you want, but please be nice:

* Don't publish my content. It's mine. Write your own.
* Remove Disqus, Tapir and Wufoo. I don't want your comments or contact e-mails and you don't want my blog search results.
* Don't serve my ads.
* Remove my analytics code, I don't want to track your page views.
* If you decide to use my design, be nice and link back.
