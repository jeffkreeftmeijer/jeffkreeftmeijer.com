I open sourced my blog to help others out getting their own blog up and running and allowing others to fork and correct stuff.

This means you can use it for whatever you want, but please be nice:

* Don't publish my content. It's mine. Write your own.
* Remove Actually and Wufoo. I don't want your comments or contact e-mails.
* Don't serve my ads.
* Remove my analytics code, I don't want to track your page views.
* If you decide to use my design, be nice and link back.
