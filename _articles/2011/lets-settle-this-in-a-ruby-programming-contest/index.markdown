<p>Last week, I launched <a href="http://codebrawl.com">Codebrawl</a>, a code contest website focussed on the Ruby programming language and open source software.</p>
<p><a href="http://codebrawl.com"><img src="http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/images/codebrawl.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>A typical contest will introduce the contestants to an open source project to solve a specific problem. For example, the first challenge was to <a href="http://codebrawl.com/contests/rspec-formatters">write an RSpec formatter</a>. We got some great entries that scrambled the whole test output to annoy your colleagues, give you a special prize after all your specs passed, or run RCov in the background to make sure your test coverage stays great.</p>
<p>The contestants are always encouraged to keep working on their projects after the contest, to try to make sure others in the Ruby community benefit from what&#8217;s created at Codebrawl.</p>
<p>Of course, we&#8217;ll also do the occasional puzzle or give the contestants a specific task. This week, we&#8217;re <a href="http://codebrawl.com/contests/pixelizing-images-with-chunkypng">introducing the contestants to ChunkyPNG</a>, by letting them pixelate an image of a Tapir. I&#8217;m excited to see how this turns out and maybe we can even find something to contribute back to ChunkyPNG.</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>The contests are open to everyone with a Github account. If you want to enter, just put your solution in a <a href="https://gist.github.com">Gist</a> and submit it. Codebrawl will make sure your entry stays hidden until the voting period starts.</p>
<p>After everyone submitted their entries, we&#8217;ll show everything on the contest page and allow the other users to vote for the entry they like best. They won&#8217;t see the contestants&#8217; names just yet, because we don&#8217;t want it to become a popularity contest.</p>
<p>After you&#8217;re done voting, the contestants&#8217; names are revealed and we&#8217;ll show the entry&#8217;s comments (we take the Gist&#8217;s comments for that), to allow the contestants and users to discuss the entries. After the voting period is over, we&#8217;ll announce a winner, give out points and put your face in the hall of fame we&#8217;re still working on.</p>
<h3>Codebrawl needs your help</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re always looking for good contest ideas, so if you know something or have some open source project you&#8217;d like us to have a play with, please <a href="http://codebrawl.com/submissions/new">submit it</a>. Also, we&#8217;re looking for prize sponsors, so if you have some app credit you want to give out or some swag you want to send across the world, be sure to <a href="jeffkreeftmeijer.com/contact">let me know</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any comments, suggestions or ideas, please leave a comment below or create <a href="https://github.com/codebrawl/codebrawl/issues">an issue on Github</a> and be sure to participate in <a href="http://codebrawl.com/contests/pixelizing-images-with-chunkypng">this week&#8217;s contest</a>. Good luck!</p>
