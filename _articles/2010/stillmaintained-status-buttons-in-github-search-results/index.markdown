<p>Ever since <a href="http://stillmaintained.com">StillMaintained</a> launched a couple of weeks ago, we&#8217;ve been working on ideas to get the gathered data back into <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>&#8217;s interface. The first step was the <a href="https://gist.github.com/731135">embeddable status buttons</a> that got <a href="http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/stillmaintained-is-still-being-maintained/">released last week</a> and have been popping up in a bunch of project <code>README</code> files already.</p>
<p>To take this even further, I&#8217;ve been working on a little userscript that shows these status buttons right in Github&#8217;s search results so you can quickly see which project is still being maintained and which ones you probably shouldn&#8217;t start using.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Chrome and Firefox users can <a href="http://stillmaintained.com/javascripts/stillmaintained.user.js">install the userscript</a> (you need <a href="http://www.greasespot.net">Greasemonkey</a> or <a href="http://8-p.info/greasekit">GreaseKit</a> first if you&#8217;re on Firefox). Safari users can simply <a href="http://stillmaintained.com/stillmaintained.safariextz">get the Safari plugin</a>.</p>
<p>Please let me know what you think in the comments if you start using it. If you&#8217;re running into problems, have any cool ideas or want to help out: the userscript (together with the rest of StillMaintained) is <a href="https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/stillmaintained">on Github</a>.</p>
