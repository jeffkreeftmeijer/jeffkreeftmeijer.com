<p><span class="small"><br><strong>tl;dr</strong> Check out <a href="http://stillmaintained.com" title="Still Maintained?">stillmaintained.com</a> to create some nice maintenance status pages for your Github projects.<br></span></p>
<p>Back when it was still nice and sunny outside, I wrote an article about <a href="http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/abandoned-open-source-projects">abandoned open source projects</a>, in which I proposed a way to mark Github projects as abandoned. There was <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1528523">some discussion</a> and a <a href="http://support.github.com/discussions/feature-requests/987-abandoned-projects">feature request</a>, but nobody seemed to have nice and clean enough solution that solved the problem.</p>
<p>I almost forgot about the whole thing, until I started getting a bunch of questions and pull requests for old projects again.</p>

<p>I decided to spend a Monday to build a simple application called <a href="http://stillmaintained.com" title="Still Maintained?">stillmaintained.com</a> that keeps a list of open source projects and makes it easy to give your own projects a state (maintained, looking for a new maintainer or abandoned). This way, each project gets a nice status page. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://stillmaintained.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/fuubar">Fuubar&#8217;s</a>.</p>
<h3>Help!</h3>
<p>The current version isn&#8217;t much yet, but you can at least start adding your projects. There&#8217;s a lot of stuff to be done and a lot of ideas to consider (like doing something about that long <a href="http://stillmaintained.com/projects">projects page</a> or adding an <span class="caps">API</span>), but hey, it&#8217;s a start.</p>
<p>If you want to help out, the project is <a href="https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/stillmaintained">on Github</a>, so be sure to create an <a href="https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/stillmaintained/issues">issue</a> if you have a great idea or run into something weird.</p>
<p>Also, it would be awesome if you took a moment and added your projects to the list. It&#8217;ll only take you about a minute.</p>
<p>What do you think? Is this a way to help solve the abandoned project issue? Have any awesome ideas already? Be sure to let me know.</p>
