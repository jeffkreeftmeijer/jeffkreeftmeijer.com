<p>I participated in the <a href="http://railsbridge.org/news_items/12">May 15 &amp; 16 Rails 3 Bugmash</a> last weekend. This was my first Bugmash (if you don&#8217;t count getting <a href="http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/navvy">Navvy</a> up to speed with Rails 3 in <a href="http://railsbridge.org/news_items/11">the last one</a>). I had lots of fun, resolved two tickets that applied to the Rails <code>master</code> and the <code>2-3-stable</code> branch, reviewed some patches by others, got five commits into Rails, <a href="http://bugmash.com/">finished in second place</a>,  and got on <a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/jeff-kreeftmeijer/commits">the contributor list</a>.</p>

<p>All Saturday (I couldn&#8217;t make it on Sunday), experienced Rails contributors and core team members were available for questions in the #railsbridge <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel. Everybody was very helpful and friendly, which  made it a lot easier to dive in and debug in the Rails source.</p>
<p>Something that also made everything a little easier was <a href="http://github.com/jeroenvandijk/rails_test_box">rails_test_box</a>. It uses <a href="http://virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a> and <a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> to set up an isolated testing environment so you can run Rails&#8217; tests without worrying about messing up your development environment.</p>
<p>It installs <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> and <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> for you, together with <a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/"><span class="caps">RVM</span></a>, so you can test on multiple databases and in multiple Rubies. And yes, it&#8217;ll even clone Rails in a shared directory, so you can develop on your Mac like you&#8217;re used to. Also, be sure to read <a href="http://blog.cookiestack.com/post/571168451/testing-rails-for-the-masses">Jeroen&#8217;s article on the Cookiestack blog</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned a lot during the Bugmash and I highly recommend every Rails developer to give it a shot next time. Thanks <a href="http://railsbridge.org/">RailsBridge</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/josevalim">@josevalim</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/spastorino">@spastorino</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/rizwanreza">@rizwanreza</a>, <a href="http://github.com/jeroenvandijk">jeroenvandijk</a> and everyone else who participated and helped out. You&#8217;re awesome.</p>
<h3>Now what?</h3>
<p>Like <a href="http://railsbridge.org/news_items/14">the Railsbridge post</a> stated: this Bugmash was the &#8220;most effective yet&#8221;. That&#8217;s great, but we&#8217;re not done yet. If you&#8217;ve participated in the Bugmash, you know that the <a href="https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994-ruby-on-rails/tickets/bins/41908">Bugmash tag in the Rails issue tracker</a> still has over 100 unresolved tickets.</p>
<p>I suggest we keep going and spend some of our time to <a href="http://www.enlightsolutions.com/articles/pledge-3-percent-for-rails-3/">keep giving back</a>, like fixing a small bug, writing some tests or reviewing a patch. Who&#8217;s with me?</p>
