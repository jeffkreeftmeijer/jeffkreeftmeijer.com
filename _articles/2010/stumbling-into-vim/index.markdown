<p>I’ve been using <a href="http://macromates.com/">Textmate</a> since I switched to the Mac a while back. It worked properly and I was fine with it. I never looked into <a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim</a> until a few months after <a href="http://twitter.com/antekpiechnik">@antekpiechinik</a> told me I should. That was last week.</p>
<p>To be honest, I thought Vim was for people that felt too cool to go out of their terminals and that it didn’t really add anything other than “I’m in the terminal”-awesomeness. Needless to say, I was wrong.</p>
<p>After I got excited by <a href="http://vimeo.com/6999927">this “Welcome to Vim”-video</a>, I dove into the <code>vimtutor</code> to learn about normal, edit and visual mode, jumping though files, deleting, adding copying and editing stuff, running terminal commands from my text editor and stuff like that. <code>vimtutor</code> is awesome, it walks you through the very basics to get familiar with the commands you’ll be using most.</p>
<p>After finishing that, I realized Vim was blazingly fast if you know the right shortcuts to use. Also, I felt quite confident about the Vim skills I learned, which lasted for about ten minutes until I tried to edit an actual Ruby file, got stuck and came to the conclusion that I forgot half of what I’ve learned.</p>
<p>Although I’m still struggling, I believe using Vim will be a lot faster in comparison to Textmate after a while. I’ll probably have to go through the <code>vimtutor</code> again some time, though.</p>
<h3>Customizing Vim</h3>
<p><img src="http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/images/vim.jpg" title="MacVim with the Railscasts color scheme and NERDTree" alt="MacVim with the Railscasts color scheme and NERDTree"></p>
<p>I’ve never really taken the time to customize Textmate, except for installing the <a href="http://railscasts.com/about">Railscasts theme</a> and the <a href="http://github.com/drnic/ruby-tmbundle">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://github.com/drnic/ruby-on-rails-tmbundle">Rails</a> bundles. That was all I needed. No RSpec or Git bundles, I prefer to run specs and push to my repository in the terminal. Heck, I never even used Textmate’s snippets and forgot to use CMD+T to open files all the time.</p>
<p>After using Vim for a while, I realized I was missing some things. So I installed the <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2175">Railscasts Vim color scheme</a> and <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658">NERDTree</a> as substitutes for Textmate’s theme and project drawer.</p>
<p>NERDTree is an awesome plugin, but since I got tired of typing <code>:NERDTreeToggle</code> to open and close it I mapped it to my F2 key. Super fast.</p>
<p>Vim has no line numbers by default, which creeped me out. Putting <code>set number</code> in my <code>./~vimrc</code> file did the trick. I searched around and stole some settings from other people too. Man, this thing is customizable.</p>
<p>Oh, I’ve put everything in my <a href="http://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/dotfiles">dotfiles repository on Github</a>. In case you need it.</p>
<p>As I said, I still have a lot to learn but I think I’ll stick to Vim for at least a while. So, keep an eye on this space for more vim stuff in the future and if you have some tips: be sure to let me know!</p>
