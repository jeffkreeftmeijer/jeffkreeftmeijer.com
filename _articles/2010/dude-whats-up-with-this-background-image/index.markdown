<p>I&#8217;ve always quite liked the scaling background image on <a href="http://fronteers.nl">the Fronteers website</a>, so I stole their idea to give my website some pizazz.</p>
<p>Since I didn&#8217;t have a great background &#8212; nor am I graphically sane enough to think of something &#8212; I decided to do something fun and fetch my latest <a href="http://mobypicture.com">Mobypicture</a> photo. That&#8217;s why there&#8217;s always a completely irrelevant image as my website&#8217;s background, like <a href="http://www.mobypicture.com/user/jkreeftmeijer/view/6221055">@roy ordering plane tickets</a> or <a href="http://www.mobypicture.com/user/jkreeftmeijer/view/6204421">@antekpiechink getting us stroopwafel McFlurry&#8217;s</a>.</p>

<p>Mobypicture doesn&#8217;t provide a direct link to your last image (<a href="http://twitter.com/mathys/status/11036784161">@mathys liked the idea though</a>), so a simple call to their <a href="http://api.mobypicture.com/doc"><span class="caps">API</span></a> and some <code>cURL</code> did the trick. The source can be found in <a href="http://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/jeffkreeftmeijer.com">this site&#8217;s repo on Github</a>.</p>
