<p>After an eight hour flight and a three hour train ride, <a href="http://twitter.com/roy" title="Roy Tomeij">@roy</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/thijsc" title="Thijs Cadier">@thijsc</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/roncadier" title="Ron Cadier">@roncadier</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/matsimitsu" title="Robert Beekman">@matsimitsu</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/antekpiechnik" title="Antek Piechnik">@antekpiechnik</a> and I arrived in Baltimore for <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010">Railsconf</a>. In this article I’ll talk about some of my personal highlights.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/piechnik/4686817595/in/set-72157624235560242"><img src="http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/images/baltimore.jpg" title="Sunset in Baltimore by Antek Piechnik" alt="Sunset in Baltimore by Antek Piechnik"></a></p>
<p>Since we didn’t go to any <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/stype/3+hour+tutorial">tutorial sessions</a>, our Railsconf started on Tuesday, which gave us the time to eat burgers, drink beers and go to Washington before the conference.</p>
<p><a name="steal"></a></p>
<p>In <a href="http://twitter.com/jnunemaker" title="John Nunemaker">@jnunemaker</a>‘s “<a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/14323">Don’t repeat yourself, repeat others</a>”, John gave a great peek into some stuff he learned while building <a href="http://mongomapper.com/">MongoMapper</a>. He urged everyone in the room to steal and write about it and explained why most of his open source projects are stolen as well. MongoMapper’s internals — like the plugin system — look really nice, I have to look into that soon.</p>
<p>For his book — <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356166?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jeffkreef-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1934356166">Agile Webdevelopment with Rails</a> — <a href="http://twitter.com/samruby" title="Sam Ruby">@samruby</a> needed a test suite to check if the code samples keep working in newer versions of Rails. In <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/12359">his talk</a> he showed a <a href="https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/4781-rjs-function-tests-fail">bug report he submitted to the Rails Lighthouse</a>, created using his open source project called <a href="http://github.com/rubys/gorp">Gorp</a> (amongst others). His approach seems like a really nice way to submit a proper bug report and a little script to reproduce the problem without manually having to generate rails applications, generate scaffolds, edit files and test manually.</p>
<p>On Tuesday evening, <a href="http://twitter.com/wycats" title="Yehuda Katz">@wycats</a> gave a <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/14132">fantastic keynote</a> that really inspired me to get my hands dirty. That meant I dove into <a href="http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/navvy">Navvy</a> after drinking some beers at the <a href="http://www.blueboxgrp.com/">Blue Box Group</a> party later that night. And no, I didn’t get anything done.</p>
<p>I missed the Ruby Hero awards that night, but I’d like to congratulate <a href="http://twitter.com/fxn" title="Xavier Noria">@fxn</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/josevalim" title="José Valim">@josevalim</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/qrush" title="Nick Quaranto">@qrush</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/tenderlove" title="Aaron Patterson">@tenderlove</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/wayneeseguin" title="Wayne E. Seguin">@wayneeseguin</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/seacreature" title="Gregory Brown">@seacreature</a>. Great job and thanks for all your work guys!</p>
<p>I was really looking forward to <a href="http://twitter.com/defunkt" title="Chris Wanstrath">@defukt</a>‘s <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/14595">talk</a> about <a href="http://code.google.com/p/redis/">Redis</a> and <a href="http://github.com/defunkt/resque">Resque</a> in <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. Chris gave some great insights into their background job processing strategy, which gave me some new ideas to steal (<a href="#steal">Nunemaker said I could</a>) for Navvy. It didn’t bother me during the talk, but I would’ve loved some slides for later reference since he gave a lot of information I can’t really remember right now.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/josephwilk" title="Joseph Wilk">@josephwilk</a> had a talk called <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/14404">Rocket Fueled Cucumbers</a> in which he explained some optimizations <a href="http://songkick.com">Songkick</a> did to their slow <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a> test suites. Although <a href="http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/steak-because-cucumber-is-for-vegetarians">I switched to Steak</a> a while back, I learned a lot from this talk and it got me thinking about some stuff we could still do with Steak in the future. Expect more on this soon.</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening, <a href="http://twitter.com/deadprogram" title="Ron Evans">@deadprogram</a> organized the <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/14604">Music Jam</a>, which treated us to some musical awesomeness I wasn’t really expecting from a bunch of programmers. Great show, I didn’t know you guys are rockstars as well.</p>

<p>The last day, <a href="http://twitter.com/imf" title="Ian McFarland">@imf</a> gave a talk called <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/14554">Agile the Pivotal Way</a> bout the way they work at <a href="http://pivotallabs.com">Pivotal Labs</a>. Ian covered things like pair programming, having breakfast and playing ping pong at work and it was a great eye opener for all of us. We even made an appointment to come over to their New York office to have a look around. Expect a post about this on the <a href="http://80beans.com">80beans</a> blog soon.</p>
<p>I’ve had a great time this year and I hope to be able to come next year again. We’re in New York for the last part of the 80beans US trip right now (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/piechnik/sets/72157624235560242/">awesome pictures by Antek</a>), but we’ll be back home on Wednesday.</p>
<p>If you’ve sent me a question or pull request: sorry for the wait, I’ll get back to you after I come back.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you’re ever in Baltimore, be sure to visit <a href="http://www.abbeyburgerbistro.com/">the Abbey Burger Bistro</a> for awesome burgers, beer and free wifi. Just sayin’.</p>
