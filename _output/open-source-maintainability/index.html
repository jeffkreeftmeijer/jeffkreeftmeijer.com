<section id="preamble" aria-label="Preamble"><p>If your open source project gains popularity, it will stay included in other
people&#8217;s projects and workflows for years. It&#8217;s impossible to predict if you&#8217;ll
have time to maintain your work in the future, but there are ways to minimize
the amount of maintenance your project requires to remain useful.</p>
<div class="image-block"><img src="notifications.png" alt="Keeping open source projects maintainable" width="1200" height="675"></div></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="dont-add-or-merge-features-you-wont-use-yourself">Don&#8217;t add or merge features you won&#8217;t use yourself</h2><div class="quote-block"><blockquote><p>It didn&#8217;t take long to add support for another database management
system into your background job library. You spent an evening getting it to
work, and fifteen minutes here and there to fix some issues in the weeks
after releasing it. You don&#8217;t use that database yourself, but you have some
users who do, and it doesn&#8217;t take long to get it set up when somebody reports
a bug.</p>
<p>After a while, an issue comes up. Everything works for the database you use,
but it&#8217;s affecting the one you added later. You don&#8217;t have a lot of time or
motivation to fix it and setting up the database takes a while. The issue sits
there for a couple of weeks until somebody else sends a pull request. You
understand most of the fix, the code looks okay and you&#8217;re glad the bug is
solved, so you merge it in.</p>
<p>When another issue comes in months later, you have a bigger problem than
before. You still don&#8217;t have a lot of time to work on it, and you have code in
your project you didn&#8217;t completely understand back when you merged it in. Let
alone now.</p></blockquote></div>
<p>Instead of merging new features or implementing them yourself, allow for easy
extension. Consider separating your project&#8217;s database layer into an adapter
that&#8217;s easy to swap out for something else. If somebody needs your library to
run on MongoDB, for example, they can write an adapter themselves.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to tell contributors to maintain their fork instead of merging
their pull request. If a feature doesn&#8217;t help your own use case, it doesn&#8217;t
need to be in your project. This can be difficult if your users are
requesting a something you don&#8217;t need, but it&#8217;ll make your project easier to
maintain in the long run.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="drop-support-for-old-versions-of-your-dependencies">Drop support for old versions of your dependencies</h2><div class="quote-block"><blockquote><p>You wrote a plug-in for your favorite editor that adds some useful
functionality. It&#8217;s a couple of lines, but wrapping it in a plug-in allows you
and others to install it using a plug-in manager.</p>
<p>A new version of the editor comes out, which adds some functionality that
makes your plug-in even more useful. You update it to take advantage of that
new feature and made sure not to break backward compatibility. It has a
version check that loads the original implementation when running in an older
version of the editor.</p>
<p>After a couple of years, you&#8217;d like to change the plug-in to add a new feature
or handle some use case better. When you open the code, you can&#8217;t find a way
to get this new feature working for the older versions of the editor.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re not sure if your changes will break anything, and you don&#8217;t have the
ancient editor version running on your machine. Although your project is
popular, you don&#8217;t know if anyone is still using the old version of the
editor.</p></blockquote></div>
<p>Whenever you start using a new version of a dependency, consider dropping
support for older versions and bumping your major version number. If your users
are tied to a previous version of your dependency, they should lock to an older
version of your project.  Dropping backward compatibility allows you to remove
conditional code that&#8217;s difficult to develop on.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t backport new features. Since you have limited resources you want your
users to switch to new versions as quickly as possible, even if that means
they&#8217;ll have to spend time updating their dependencies.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="hand-over-projects-if-you-cant-help-anymore">Hand over projects if you can&#8217;t help anymore</h2><div class="quote-block"><blockquote><p>You maintain an add-on for some kind of test framework, that&#8217;s specifically
suited for a problem you have. Since others have the same problem, your
project is used by hundreds of people. You haven&#8217;t implemented anything you
don&#8217;t use yourself, and you quickly drop support for old versions of the test
framework.</p>
<p>After a while, you start using another test framework on a daily basis. Maybe
because a new project at your job uses it, or your new situation doesn&#8217;t have
that problem your add-on fixed. You stop using your add-on.</p>
<p>Your project still provides value for its users, but you don&#8217;t have time to
reproduce issues you haven&#8217;t run into yourself. There&#8217;s a handful of people
excited about your project, so you usually receive a pull request when
something breaks.</p>
<p>After merging pull requests for a while, the code starts to lack structure
because there&#8217;s nobody actively maintaining the project. The code becomes
increasingly difficult to understand, and it&#8217;s becoming difficult to even
press the merge button without breaking the build.</p></blockquote></div>
<p>If you stop using your own project, you&#8217;re not fit to maintain it anymore. You
don&#8217;t have to do all the work, but you need to be among the first to know when
something breaks. If you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;re hurting the project more than you&#8217;re
helping.</p>
<p>Hand the project over to somebody that actively uses your project and knows the
code. If you can&#8217;t, open an issue in your tracker to announce you&#8217;re looking for
a new maintainer. Explain that you can&#8217;t help anymore and mention that you won&#8217;t
be answering issues or reviewing pull requests.</p></section>
