My personal blog. ["Check it out":http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com]! :D

h2. Using the source

I open sourced my blog to help others out getting their own Jekyll blog up and running and allowing others to fork it and correct stuff (or even write guest articles).

This means you can use it for whatever you want, but please be nice:

* Don't publish my content. It's mine. Write your own.
* Don't serve my ads.
* Remove my analytics code, I don't want to track your page views.
* Remove the Disqus code, or at least make sure your comments don't end up in my inbox.
* If you decide to use my design, be nice and link back.

I don't want to bitch about licensing, I wouldn't sue you even if I had a proper licence. Again: just be nice. Deal? :)
