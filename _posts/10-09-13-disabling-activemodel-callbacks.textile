title: Disabling ActiveModel callbacks
excerpt: Trying to figure out how to temporarily disable callbacks. How would you solve this?

Remember the last time you wanted to create, update, save or destroy a record or document and your @before_create@ or @after_update@ fired when you didn't want it to? Or are you using "Mongoid":http://mongoid.org and did you include @Mongoid::Timestamps@ but don't want your @updated_at@ attribute to change for a specific action?

Think for a second. Adding callbacks to disable them later is nasty and will result in code that's more difficult to maintain. You probably made a wrong design decision here, so get back to the drawing board and rethink this part of your application if you can.

If you can't or you're completely sure you have a valid reason to skip your callbacks, you probably tried something like "removing the callback method":http://intridea.com/2009/3/12/temporarily-disable-activerecord-callbacks but found out that didn't work anymore.

The way callbacks are handled completely changed in Rails 3, breaking approaches like above. The new "@skip_callback@":http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveSupport/Callbacks/ClassMethods/skip_callback and "@set_callback@":http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveSupport/Callbacks/ClassMethods/set_callback can be of some help though:

{% highlight ruby %}
class User
  # I'm using Mongoid, but this should work for anything based on 
  # ActiveModel.
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::Timestamps
  
  def sneaky_update(attributes)
    User.skip_callback(:save, :before, :set_updated_at)
    User.update_attributes(attributes)
    User.set_callback(:save, :before, :set_updated_at)
  end
  
end
{% endhighlight %}

This will keep @Mongoid::Timestamps@ from calling @set_updated_at@ before saving the Document.

Because I didn't like how this looked, I added a method called @without_callback@ to @ActiveSupport::Callbacks@ to allow you to temporarily disable callbacks in a block. Just throw this in @config/initializers/without_callback.rb@:

{% highlight ruby %}
module ActiveSupport::Callbacks::ClassMethods
  def without_callback(*args, &block)
    skip_callback(*args)
    yield
    set_callback(*args)
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

And you'll be able to do stuff like this: 

{% highlight ruby %}
class User
  # I'm using Mongoid, but this should work for anything based on 
  # ActiveModel.
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::Timestamps
  
  def sneaky_update(attributes)
    User.without_callback(:save, :before, :set_updated_at)
      update_attributes(attributes)
    end
  end
  
end
{% endhighlight %}

At least, that's how I solved it. I'm not completely sure this is the prettiest way to do something like this. Do you know of a better way? Be sure to let me know in the comments.
