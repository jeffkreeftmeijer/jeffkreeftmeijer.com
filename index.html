  <p>In an earlier edition of Ruby Magic we implemented a 30-line HTTP server in Ruby. Without having to write a lot of code, we were able to handle HTTP GET requests and serve a simple Rack application. This time, weâ€™ll take our home made server a bit further. When weâ€™re done, weâ€™ll have a web server that can serve Railsâ€™ famous fifteen minute blog that allows you to create, update and delete posts.

  <p>Web servers, and HTTP in general, might seem difficult to understand. How does the browser format a request, and how does the response get sent to the user? In this Ruby Magic episode weâ€™ll learn how a to build a simple Ruby HTTP server in 30 lines of code. When weâ€™re done, our server will handle HTTP GET requests and weâ€™ll use it to serve a simple Rack app.

  <p>After posting a tweet about using fixtures a while ago, David StrauÃŸreplied and asked me for some pointers to using fixtures in CarrierWave, the Rails file uploading gem, so I decided to dive in and see if I could get it to work. Hereâ€™s how I would do it.</p>

  <p>Since Vim 7.4, you can enable both the number and relativenumer settings at the same time, which will give you something I'll call hybrid line number mode. Using that, all lines will show their relative line number, except for the line you're currently on, which will show its absolute line number.</p>

  <p>While I donâ€™t think the possibility of something growing over time and becoming an eyesore sometime in the future is a good reason to start making the code more extensible, I do believe that this code could use some refactoring.</p>
